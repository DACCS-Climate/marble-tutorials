# PAVICS Examples

The [PAVICS](https://pavics.ouranos.ca/) node has compiled a library of example tutorial notebooks for services
found on their node.

Many of these notebooks discuss services and processes that are available on nodes across the Marble network and are 
intended as examples that can be adapted as needed.
