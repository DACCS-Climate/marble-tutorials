## <a id="getting-started"></a>Getting Started
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) will be our primary method for your 
interactions with the Marble Platform. JupyterLab contains a complete environment for
interactive scientific computing which runs in your web browser. Jupyter is an
open source python project that was started by scientists like yourselves who
wanted a more effective way to interact with their computers. While Jupyter notebooks cannot 
be used for productionized products, they allow for more readable and understandable projects.
Perfect for Exploratory Data Analysis, Modelling and Experimentation.

Once logged in you will see a dropdown list of the images available on the particular node. What is available will differ from node to node.

Select the one you want and click `Start`.
