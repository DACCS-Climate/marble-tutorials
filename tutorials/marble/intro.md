# The Marble Platform

```{contents}
:local:
```

Marble is a federated network of web services nodes that provide access to large climate and satellite data sets,
offer support for cloud-based data analytics, and implement Open Geoscience Consortium (OGC) standards for finding and
interacting with data. 

The key principle is to bring the computation to where the data is, rather than vice versa.
The platform strives to serve the diverse needs of climate researchers, non-profits, government agencies at all levels, 
civic minded individuals, educators and journalists, enabling them to study and communicate the impacts of climate 
change without worrying about the technical logistics.
