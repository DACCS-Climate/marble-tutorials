# Getting Started

So you want to deploy your own Marble node? You're in the right place!

These tutorials will cover the initial installation and setup of your Marble node. Once your node has been set up we
will also discuss how to join the Marble network which will connect your node to the ecosystem of other Marble nodes.

```{note}
You can choose to use the Marble software without joining the network if you wish. You will still be able to use many of
the features that Marble offers but your node will not be connected to the other nodes in the network.
