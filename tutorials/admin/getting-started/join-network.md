# Joining the Network

Once you have [installed](installation.md) your Marble node on your server, it is time to connect it to other Marble
nodes. 

This will allow users of your node to discover data and services available on other nodes and will allow other users in
the Marble community to make use of your node as well. By joining the network, you contribute to the Marble community
and help make computational climate science more accessible and collaborative. Welcome!

## Add your information to the registry

To join the network, you need to add your node's information to the 
[Marble Node Registry](https://github.com/DACCS-Climate/Marble-node-registry). This is a registry of all nodes in the
network and is used by various tools and components of each Marble node to know how to pass information between nodes.

To add your node's information, [make a pull request](https://github.com/DACCS-Climate/Marble-node-registry/pulls) to 
the Marble Node Registry with an updated `node_registry.json` file containing your node's information.

To see which information should be included see the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/DACCS-Climate/Marble-node-registry/blob/main/README.md#add-or-update-information-about-a-marble-node).

```{note}
Updating the `node_registry.json` file requires some knowledge on how to edit [JSON](https://www.json.org) files.
```
