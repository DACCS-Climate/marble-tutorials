# Geoscience Data Analysis Using Marble

This tutorial seeks provide users with a guide on using Marble for their geoscience computing needs. This tutorial 
primarily focuses on data manipulation, analysis and some machine learning techniques. 

These tutorials do not endeavour to teach advanced topics but instead are a resource for providing a strong foundation 
in common tools used in scientific computing.

## Computing Environment

The examples in the tutorials are written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and are 
displayed as part of a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Knowledge of both of these are required to properly
understand these tutorials.

We recommend the following tutorials as a good starting point if you're unfamiliar with any of the above:
