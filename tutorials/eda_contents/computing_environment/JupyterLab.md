# Intro to JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) will be our primary method for your 
interactions with the Marble platform for these tutorials. JupyterLab contains a complete environment for
interactive scientific computing which runs in your web browser.

If you are unfamiliar with the platform, it is strongly recommended that you spend time reviewing the documentation as this tutorial will assume some
prior familiarity with the JupyterLab environment.

## Markdown
JupyterLab allows for rich text documentation using Markdown. To improve
