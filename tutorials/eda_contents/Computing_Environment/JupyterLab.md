# Intro to JupyterLab

*The notes below are modified from the book [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) which is freely available from rabernat GitHub.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) will be our primary method for your 
interactions with the Marble Platform. JupyterLab contains a complete environment for
interactive scientific computing which runs in your web browser. Jupyter is an
open source python project that was started by scientists like yourselves who
wanted a more effective way to interact with their computers. While Jupyter notebooks cannot 
be used for productionized products, they allow for more readable and understandable projects.
Perfect for Exploratory Data Analysis, Modelling and Experimentation. 

JupyterLab has excellent documentation. Rather than repeat that documentation
here, we point you to their docs. The following pages are particularly relevant:

- [The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
- [Working with Files](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html)
- [The Text Editor](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_editor.html)
- [Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)
- [Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html)
- [Managing Kernels and Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/running.html


It is strongly recommended that you spend time reviewing the documentation as this tutorial will assume some
prior familiarith with the JupyterLab environment.


## Markdown
JupyterLab allows for rich text documentation using Markdown. To improve
your notebook readability and organisation, check out the resources below.
