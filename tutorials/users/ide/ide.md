# Integrated Development Environment

Marble is built on a federated architecture and needed a development environment that is user friendly, 
self-contained, but could also be customized to offer a tailored experience.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was the solution, as it typically consists of a source code editor,
build automation tools, and a debugger.

JupyterLab is the IDE of choice for Marble.  JupyterLab is a web-based development environment well suited for 
arranging workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. 

Computational notebooks are the main workspace in JupyterLab.  They are shareable documents that combine computer code, plain 
language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive 
controls.

Compared to other notebook authoring applications such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab offers a more advanced, 
feature rich, and streamlined experience for creating and sharing computational notebooks.
