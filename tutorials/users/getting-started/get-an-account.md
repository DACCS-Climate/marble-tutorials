# Create an account


Marble is open to anyone, anywhere in the world. Anyone can get an account on the platform and start examining a variety
of climate related questions without worrying about provisioning their own computing and storage environments.

## Request an account on a node

To get an account, first choose a node as user accounts are associated with nodes, not the network overall. 

Once you've selected a node, [navigate to the node's home page](explore-the-network.md#explore-the-nodes) and follow the
instructions listed there to request a user account. Since each node is managed by different organizations, each may 
have a different procedure for requesting an account.
