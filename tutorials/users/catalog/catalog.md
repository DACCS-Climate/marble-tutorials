# Marble Data Calalog

One of the goals of the Marble network is to provide a robust catalog of data available on the network. To do this, we 
use the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/en) or "STAC". This is an emerging standard for describing
data having spatial and/or temporal characteristics. 

This tutorial explains how data is exposed on the network using STAC and how to search for and find access links to data 
via the STAC Browser that is integrated into each Marble node and via a python "client" within your Jupyter notebooks or
other python code. 

If you are new to STAC, then before proceeding further with this tutorial please review a brief 
[introduction to the STAC specification](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/intro-to-stac/) that will familiarize you with 
fundamental STAC concepts. You can also read more technical details of
the STAC specification [here](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (if you are interested.)
