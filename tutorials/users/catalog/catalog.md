# Marble Data Calalog

One of the goals of the Marble network is to provide a robust collection of data on the network and make it discoverable and accessible 
via a convenient catalog. To implement such a catalog, we have chosen to 
use an emerging standard for describing data having spatial and/or temporal characteristics, called 
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/en) and abbreviated as "STAC". 

This tutorial explains how data is exposed on the network using STAC and how to search for and find access links to data 
either via the STAC Browser that is integrated into each Marble node or via a python "client" within your Jupyter notebooks or
other python code. 

If you are new to STAC, then before proceeding further with this tutorial please review a brief 
[introduction to STAC](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/intro-to-stac/) that will familiarize you with 
fundamental STAC concepts. You can also read more technical details of
the STAC specification [here](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (if you are interested.)
