# Data Catalog

One of the goals of the Marble network is to provide a robust collection of data on the network and make it discoverable and accessible 
via a convenient catalog. To implement such a catalog, we have chosen to 
use an emerging standard for describing data having spatial and/or temporal characteristics, called 
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://stacspec.org/en) and abbreviated as "STAC". 

This tutorial explains how STAC is used to make data discoverable and searchable across the Marble network using the STAC browser web interface or via the `pystac` python client. 

If you are new to STAC, then before proceeding further with this tutorial please review a brief 
[introduction to STAC](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/intro-to-stac/) that will familiarize you with 
fundamental STAC concepts. You can also read more technical details of
the STAC specification [here](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (if you are interested.)
